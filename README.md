# Procedure world generator for realistic terrain and biomes 🌍
This is a solo project and a core part of a game I'm developing (which may also be shared on GitHub later).

# Project goal 🎯
Create a procedurally generated world that mimics the terrain and biome diversity of Earth. The generation is designed from scratch, inspired by real-world geography, but implemented with my own ideas and techniques. While there are similar projects out there, I’m challenging myself to build this **independently** with **randomness**. Yes, I will put randomness everywhere until I can't anymore

# Contributions & Feedback 🤝
* If you find my code confusing or feel like something could be improved — I'm very open to suggestions!
  * Advice and constructive criticism are always welcome.
  * If you open a pull request, please include a 'changelog.txt' that describes what you've modified so I can review your changes easily.
  * Even just ideas or design feedback are appreciated!

# Current state
This project is being built by someone with **no experience in procedural generation**. Expect messy commits, half-baked ideas, and raw experimentation
