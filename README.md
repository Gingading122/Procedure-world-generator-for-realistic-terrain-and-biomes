# Procedure world generator for realistic terrain and biomes
The first thing to say is this solo project of mine serves as a part of my game, which may go on Github later
My goal is straightforward, create a procedure world similar to Earth's terrain and biomes. I know there might be some works on the Internet, but I'm eager to complete this project on my own
If you find my codes itchy and want some changes, I will be very pleased to listen to. Every advice is appreciated!
